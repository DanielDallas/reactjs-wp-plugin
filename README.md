# React Plugin for WordPress

## Description

The **React Plugin for WordPress** allows you to embed a React component inside your WordPress site. This plugin dynamically loads React and ReactDOM from a CDN and renders a simple React component inside a specified HTML element. You can control where the component appears using shortcodes, hooks, or manual placement in theme files.

## Features

- Embed a **React component** anywhere in WordPress.
- Use a **shortcode** to insert the component inside posts, pages, or widgets.
- Automatically render the component in **header, footer, or theme templates**.
- Lightweight and fast, using **React from a CDN**.

## Installation

### Method 1: Install via WordPress Plugin Directory (Coming Soon)

_Currently, this plugin is not available in the WordPress Plugin Directory. You must install it manually._

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. **Download the plugin files**.
2. Extract the folder and **upload it to** `/wp-content/plugins/react-plugin/`.
3. Go to **WordPress Admin > Plugins** and **activate** the plugin.

## How to Use

### 1. Using the Shortcode (Recommended)

You can add the React component **anywhere** using the following shortcode:

```html
[react_component]
```

ðŸ“Œ **Works inside:** Posts, Pages, and Widgets.

### 2. Auto-Render in Footer

The plugin **automatically renders** the React component in the footer of every page. To disable this, comment out the `wp_footer` hook inside `react-plugin.php`.

### 3. Manually Add to Theme Files

If you want to **control where it appears**, add the following line inside any PHP file in your theme:

```php
<?php echo do_shortcode('[react_component]'); ?>
```

ðŸ“Œ **Use in:** `header.php`, `footer.php`, `single.php`, `page.php`, etc.
